## Building
Want to build the latest (potentially unreleased) version of the mod yourself? Follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of the repo on your client.
2. Create a file in the same directory as AutoGG.csproj called SteamLibrary.targets and copy the following into it:
```
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
    <PropertyGroup>
        <SteamLibraryPath>REPLACE</SteamLibraryPath>
    </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
3. Replace the text 'REPLACE' with the location of your 'SteamLibrary' folder (or 'ApplicationSupport/Steam' on OSX).
4. Build the mod using either the [dotnet cli](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download), [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), or some other means.
